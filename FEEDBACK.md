# Feedback and Recommendations for SENTINEL PC Optimizer

## Feedback

Okay, let's break down this Netlify deployment configuration based on your project structure and the GitHub Actions workflow.

The Netlify settings themselves are technically correct for deploying the static landing page:

Branch to deploy: main - Correct, this matches your workflow triggers. Netlify will deploy commits merged/pushed to main.
Base directory: (blank) - Correct. Your _wwwroot and .github folders are at the root, so no base directory is needed.
Build command: (blank) - Correct. Your landing page (index.html and its assets) is static and doesn't require a build step on Netlify. The executable is built separately by GitHub Actions.
Publish directory: _wwwroot - Correct. This tells Netlify that the content to be served live is inside the _wwwroot folder in your repository.
HOWEVER, there's a critical disconnect with how your executable (SentinelPC.exe) is handled:

GitHub Actions: Your workflow builds SentinelPC.exe and places it in _wwwroot/publish, then uploads it as a GitHub Actions artifact.
Netlify Deployment: Netlify pulls the code directly from your main branch as it exists in the repository.
The Problem: The GitHub Actions workflow does not automatically commit the built SentinelPC.exe back into the _wwwroot/publish directory in your repository's main branch. It only creates a downloadable artifact associated with that specific workflow run.
Therefore, when Netlify deploys your main branch:

It will correctly find and deploy _wwwroot/index.html and _wwwroot/Assets/....
It will NOT find _wwwroot/publish/SentinelPC.exe because that file isn't actually checked into your main branch by the workflow.
Your download link (href="publish/SentinelPC.exe") on the live Netlify site will result in a 404 Not Found error.
How to Fix This (Choose ONE):

Option 1: Manual Commit (Simplest but Manual)

Run the GitHub Actions workflow (e.g., by pushing to main).
Download the executables artifact from the completed workflow run on GitHub.
Manually place the SentinelPC.exe file inside the _wwwroot/publish/ directory in your local repository.
Commit this .exe file to your main branch and push it to GitHub.
Now, when Netlify deploys main, the .exe file will be included.
Downside: You have to repeat this manual step every time you want to release a new version. Large binary files in Git are generally discouraged.
Option 2: Use GitHub Releases (Recommended for Executables)

Modify your GitHub Actions workflow: Instead of just uploading an artifact, add steps to create a GitHub Release and attach the _wwwroot/publish/SentinelPC.exe file to that release. (You can use actions like actions/create-release and actions/upload-release-asset).
Modify your index.html: Change the download link (href) to point directly to the download URL of the asset in your latest GitHub Release. GitHub provides stable URLs for this (e.g., https://github.com/johnwesleyquintero/SentinelPC/releases/latest/download/SentinelPC.exe).
Benefit: This is the standard way to distribute executables built via CI. Your Netlify site stays lightweight (just the landing page), and the download comes directly from GitHub Releases. No need to commit the .exe to your main branch.
Option 3: Commit Built File via Workflow (Complex)

Modify your GitHub Actions workflow: After building, add steps to configure Git within the action, commit the _wwwroot/publish/SentinelPC.exe file, and push it back to the main branch.
Downsides: Can be tricky to get right (authentication, avoiding infinite loops if the push triggers the action again), pollutes Git history with large binary files, generally not recommended.
Conclusion:

The Netlify configuration settings (main branch, _wwwroot publish directory, no build command) are correct for deploying your static landing page. However, your current process will not automatically include the SentinelPC.exe built by GitHub Actions in the Netlify deployment.

You need to either manually commit the built .exe (Option 1) or, preferably, modify your workflow to use GitHub Releases and update your download link accordingly (Option 2).
